## SLIDE 1: THE PROBLEM STATEMENT
### "The Hidden Crisis in Fodder Management"

*   **Fragmented Information:** Fodder supply (agricultural) and livestock data (animal husbandry) are currently maintained in separate silos, preventing a unified view.
*   **Delayed Visibility:** Shortages are often identified only after field-level stress or animal distress appears, leading to reactive emergency spending.
*   **Poor Redistribution:** Significant surplus fodder in certain districts is not systematically identified or moved to deficit districts due to lack of real-time mapping.
*   **Manual Monitoring:** Heavy dependence on manual reports and static spreadsheets slows down the administrative response time.
*   **Reactive Administration:** Actions are typically taken during a crisis instead of through strategic, advance planning.

## SLIDE 2: THE SOLUTION
### "FORAGE (Pashu Poshana) - A Data-Driven Command Center"

*   **Common Planning Framework:** A unified digital platform for reviewing fodder status across all 26 districts and 660+ Mandals of Andhra Pradesh.
*   **Advance Preparedness Model:** A statistical forecasting system that allows officials to act months before a shortage occurs.
*   **Logistical Coordination:** Bridges the gap between surplus and deficit districts by identifying "Resource Hubs" for systemic redistribution.
*   **Structured Monitoring:** Transparent, regular, and automated monitoring of fodder availability and animal demand metrics.
*   **Decision-Support Input:** Provides timely and reliable data-driven inputs for senior administrative decision-making.
*   **Sustainable Intervention:** Reduces dependence on emergency, last-minute interventions by maintaining a "Sufficiency Buffer."

## SLIDE 3: KEY FEATURES
### "Built for Governance, Powered by Intelligence"

1.  **Sufficiency Index:** A proprietary single-score metric indicating fodder adequacy. It instantly tells an official if a region is **Safe (Green)** or **Critical (Red)**.
2.  **Geographical Dashboards:** Multi-level visibility from **Statewide Overview** down to **District** and **Mandal-level** dynamics.
3.  **Early Warning Alerts:** Predictive signals and visual heatmaps that flag potential fodder shortages up to 6 months in advance.
4.  **Surplus–Deficit Mapping:** Intelligent identification of surplus districts to support planned fodder movement and logistics optimization.
5.  **Pashu Sahayak (AI Interactivity):** A conversational AI interface (STARK NLU) that allows officials to query the database using plain English (e.g., *"Which Mandal needs the most help in Prakasam?"*).
